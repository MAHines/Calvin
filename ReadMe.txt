Calvin was designed to enable students enrolled at Cornell University to
perform our standard inquiry-based laboratory experiments at home during
the Covid-19 pandemic. Calvin is a compact interpreted language that
simulates student-designed experiments from laboratory data collected at
Cornell shortly prior to lock down.

Student groups (or individual students) design their experiments for
Calvin using a text editor. (Syntax coloring is available for a number
of popular free editors.) Students then e-mail their experiment to a
watched folder in the cloud that they cannot otherwise access. This
maintains confidentiality. Calvin opens the file, simulates the
experiment, generates a rtf file documenting the outcome and csv files
of any spectra produced, zips the whole shebang, and uploads the result
to a different folder that the students can access from an internet
browser. At Cornell, we have implemented this using Box, because it
enables Cornell authentication. Students can only access their specific
output folder.
